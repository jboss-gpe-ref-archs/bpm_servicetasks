== Overview

image::images/springservicetask.png[]

Purpose of this example is to demonstrate use of a custom workItemHandler that leverages the Spring framework to persist a record in a database. 
This approach should be avoided if possible. 
Instead, it is preferrable that business functions that leverages third-party libraries be encapsulated as a service (as per SOA) and invoked by a SOAP/REST/EJB service task. 
In some edge cases however, SOA may not be an option and thus this business functionality needs to run in the same thread of execution as the BPM process engine.

== Config and Deployment:  Local Environment

=== local:  Clone this reference architecture

This reference architecture will be cloned both in your local computer as well as in your remote BPM Suite 6 Openshift environment.
To clone this reference architecture in your local environment, execute the following:

--------
git clone https://github.com/jboss-gpe-ref-archs/bpm_servicetasks.git
--------

Doing so will create a directory in your local computer called:  bpm_servicetasks.
For the purposes of this documentation, this directory will be referred to as $REF_ARCH_HOME.

=== local: Build the Reference Architecture
This reference architecture includes various sub-projects that need to be built locally.
To build the various sub-projects, execute the following:

. cd $REF_ARCH_HOME
. mvn clean install -DskipTests
