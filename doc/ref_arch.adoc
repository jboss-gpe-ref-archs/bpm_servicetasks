== Abstract

== Overview

== Pre-Requisites

== Procedure
* For the purposes of this documentation, the name _$REF_ARCH_HOME_ refers to the root directory of this reference architecture.

== Performance Testing
* JMeter is used to drive testing of the reference architecture.
* You do not need to download a seperate JMeter binary nor source distribution
* Instead, JMeter will be downloaded, installed and appropriately configured as part of the configuration found in $REF_ARCH_HOME/loadtest
* jmeter maven plugin
** Notice use of the com.lazerycode.jmeter:jmeter-maven-plugin in _$REF_ARCH_HOME/loadtest/pom.xml_ 
** This maven plugin downloads, installs and appropriately configures JMeter
** This maven plugin is also used to drive test scenarios
* ref_arch.jmx
** A sample default jmeter load test definition file is included in: $REF_ARCH_HOME/loadtest/src/test/jmeter/ref_arch.jmx
** This jmeter load test definition file can be viewed and manipulated via the JMeter GUI by:
*** cd $REF_ARCH_HOME/loadtest
** Notice that the default, OOB configuration is to spawn a single client that invokes a single test case
** ./jmeter_gui.sh
* Java Sampler
** Also included is an example Java _Sampler_ at:  $REF_ARCH_HOME/loadtest/src/test/java/com/redhat/gpe/refarch/bpm_domain/loadtest/ExampleJMeterClient.java
** The use of a JMeter _sampler_ class is optional
** cd $REF_ARCH_HOME/loadtest
** mvn clean verify
