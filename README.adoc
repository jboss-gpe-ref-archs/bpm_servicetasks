== PURPOSE:
* sentence or 
* two on the purpose of this ref arch

== OVERVIEW:
short paragraph 

or two that highlights what the reader is going to learn.  It's nice to have a high-level overview of the data flow and deployment architecture ... although avoid too many details at this point.

This section should also link to the {ref_arch_doc}.
